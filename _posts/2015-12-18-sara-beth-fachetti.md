Sara Beth Fachetti is a media lover since a young age. From writing and reading dozens of stories since the age of six, to blogging since it became a thing. From starring in Grandpa Fachetti's home videos to catching the latest flicks in theaters on the regular. Sara is in love with all things media. 

Sara graduated from Binghamton University with a BA in Analytical Writing for the Media (further proof). 

Consistently fascinated with dozens of ideas, technologies, and media at one time, Sara created Fachetti Media Co. as a holding company for all of her media adventures and to satisfy her business acumen. Fachetti Media Co. currently owns Cuore e Casa, Sara's faith and home focused blog, as well as The Common Ground Sophisticate, a curate digital lifestyle magazine for the everygirl.

Together, these pursuits currently satisfy Sara's craving for creating and curating media. Tomorrow? Who knows ;)
